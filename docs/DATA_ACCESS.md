# Data Sources

## Currently Used

### US Census Bureau ACS (API)

Demographics and tract boundaries for Durham County.

- **Demographics endpoint:** `https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5`
- **Geometry endpoint:** Census TIGER/Line via ArcGIS REST
- **Auth:** Free API key required (`CENSUS_API_KEY` env var, stored as GitHub secret) from https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
- **Variables:** Total population, median household income, race/ethnicity
- **Script:** `scripts/fetch_durham_data.py`

### NCDOT NC Vision Zero (API)

Durham County crash totals for calibrating simulation volumes.

- **Endpoint:** Power BI API (constants in `backend/config.py`)
- **Dashboard:** https://ncvisionzero.org/data-analytics/crash-query-tool/
- **Auth:** None (public)
- **Provides:** Aggregate crash count (~100,909 across 2018-2024)
- **Limitation:** No lat/long coordinates, so crashes cannot be geocoded to census tracts. The simulation generates geographic distribution instead.
- **Script:** `scripts/fetch_ncdot_crash_data.py` (caches to `ncdot_calibration.json`)

## Needed for Production

### Strava Metro

Real pedestrian/cyclist volume data from GPS traces.

- **URL:** https://metro.strava.com/
- **Auth:** Institutional license required
- **Would provide:** Observed active transportation volumes per road segment
- **Current substitute:** Simulated with demographic-correlated bias patterns matching Strava's documented 20-30% undercounting in low-income/minority areas

### StreetLight Data

Multi-modal traffic volume estimates from mobile device data.

- **URL:** https://www.streetlightdata.com/
- **Auth:** Institutional license required
- **Would provide:** Pedestrian, cyclist, and vehicle volume estimates by location
- **Current substitute:** Same simulation as Strava Metro (both exhibit similar demographic bias patterns)

### NCDOT TEAAS

Complete NC crash database with detailed records.

- **Access:** Free for government, municipal, and research entities, but requires completing a two-part training program (online modules + instructor-led class) before account provisioning
- **Download:** https://dmvcrashweb.dot.state.nc.us/teaas/
- **Info:** https://connect.ncdot.gov/resources/safety/Pages/TEAAS-Crash-Data-System.aspx
- **Would provide:** Individual crash records with road-level location data (all reportable NC crashes since 1990)
- **Current substitute:** Simulated crash records calibrated to NC Vision Zero API totals

## Potential Additions

### OpenStreetMap (Infrastructure Geometry)

Crowdsourced map data with pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure tagging (footways, crossings, bike routes). The US saw record pedestrian mapping growth in 2024 driven by the OSM US Pedestrian Working Group and Meta's Walkabout Initiative.

- **Extract:** Custom bounding-box extract via https://extract.bbbike.org/ (Durham is not pre-made; draw a region). Alternatively, query directly via the Overpass API.
- **License:** ODbL (open)
- **Formats:** OSM/PBF, Shapefile, GeoJSON, GeoParquet
- **Useful for:** Test 3 (Infrastructure Audit) and Test 4 (Suppressed Demand). Map actual infrastructure presence per census tract against income quintiles to validate whether AI allocation recommendations match real-world conditions.

### Durham Vision Zero Dashboard (Crash Validation)

Interactive ArcGIS dashboard showing fatal and serious injury crashes in Durham from 2016 to present, maintained by the city.

- **Dashboard:** https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/fd720475a8de48ef82f801dc8d6d6677
- **Program page:** https://www.durhamnc.gov/2995/Vision-Zero
- **Auth:** None (public, view-only)
- **Provides:** Crash locations along the High Injury Network, temporal trends, severity breakdowns. Verified stats: ~23 fatalities/year, a pedestrian crash every 3 days on average.
- **Limitation:** View-only ArcGIS dashboard with no bulk data export. Useful for manual validation of Test 2 crash patterns, not for pipeline integration.

### GoDurham GTFS (Transit Routes)

Transit route and schedule data for Durham's bus system. The Durham Open Data Portal does not include transit data; this is the actual source.

- **URL:** https://godurhamtransit.org/developer-resources
- **Auth:** None (public)
- **Formats:** GTFS and GTFS-RT
- **Useful for:** Enriching equity analysis by mapping transit access gaps against income and race demographics. Areas with poor transit access may correlate with suppressed active transportation demand.

### DVRPC Bike/Ped Count Program (Methodology Reference)

Philadelphia-region bike/ped counting program with fully open data and a documented Eco-Counter integration pipeline.

- **Data portal:** https://www.dvrpc.org/traffic/bikepedtravelmonitoring/
- **Open data:** https://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/
- **GitHub pipeline:** https://github.com/dvrpc/eco-counter-import
- **Formats:** CSV, Shapefile, GeoJSON
- **Useful for:** Not Durham-specific, but serves as a reference for how to structure real count data integration if Durham publishes Eco-Counter data in the future. Their pipeline architecture could inform Test 1 (Volume Estimation) ground truth methodology.
